## About Rosalía and her 3 albums
Rosalia Vila Tobella, known mononymously as Rosalía, is a Spanish singer and songwriter.
She has three albums: Los Ángeles, El Mal Querer and MOTOMAMI.
- "Los Ángeles": released in 2017, is the debut studio album by Spanish singer Rosalía. The concept album featured songs inspired by traditional flamenco music.
- "El Mal Querer": released in 2018. Presented as experimental and conceptual, revolving around a toxic relationship, the album was inspired by the anonymous 13th-century Occitan novel Flamenca. Therefore, every song on the album is conceived as a chapter of the book.
- "MOTOMAMI": is the third studio album by Spanish singer Rosalía, released on 18 March 2022 through Columbia Records.  It's a concept album about her feelings during the past three years in the form of a collage of the singer's musical influences, especially in Latin music; all in an experimental key. The album is separated into two parts; Moto is the divine, experimental, frictional and the strongest part of the album, while Mami is the genuine, personal, confessional and vulnerable part.
